## Assignment
This project contains 3 smart contracts written in Solidity that address three distinct exercises.
### Exercise 1: DataReconstructions.sol
The smart contract DataReconstructions.sol is the solution for exercise 1. This contract handles the reconstruction of data from data fragments.

### Exercise 2: DataFragmentAllocator.sol
The smart contract DataFragmentAllocator.sol is the solution for exercise 2. This contract manages the allocation of data fragments to various nodes.

### Exercise 3: NetworkRouting.sol
The smart contract NetworkRouting.sol is the solution for exercise 3. This contract handles a network graph and finds the path with the minimum latency between two nodes.
